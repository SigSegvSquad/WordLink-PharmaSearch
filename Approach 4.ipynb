       " 'Development Of Muco Adhesive Orally Disintegrating Tablets Containing Tamarind Gum Coated Tea Powder': 'keywordsoral careorally disintegrating tablettea powdermicrowaveadhesive propertytamarind gumthe aim of this study was to design and evaluate mucoadhesive orally disintegrating tablets manufactured bymicrowave irradiation and containing polysaccharide. we prepared orally disintegrating tea tablets odttscontaining a 1 ww mass fraction of one of ﬁve polysaccharides gum arabic carrageenan guar gum tamarindgum or pectin and evaluated the swelling degree tablet hardness friability disintegration time and adhesiveproperties. all tablets had a swelling degree of about 1 mm a hardness of over 13 n and a friability degreeof  1. tablets containing gum arabic and tamarind gum had disintegration times of 30 s or less and satisﬁedrequirements as orally disintegrating tablets. this could be attributed to their high void contents which allowedfor water penetration. the adhesive properties and particle retention ratios were highest in odtts containingtamarind gum which was thought to be caused by the rapid disintegration and high viscosity of the tamarindgum itself. when we investigated changing the mass fraction of tamarind gum we found 1 ww was mostsuitable for rapid disintegration and high adhesiveness. the odtts containing 1 ww tamarind gum showedsigniﬁcant growth inhibition towards streptococcus mutans. therefore microwave irradiation technology andaddition of tamarind gum could be used to manufacture mucoadhesive orally disintegrating tablets for oral care.1. introductionin the modern era the pneumonia death rate has been increasingwith population aging and superaging societies miyashita andyamauchi 2018. over 90 of pneumonia deaths are of older adultsaged 65 years or older and about 70 of older adults suﬀering frompneumonia have aspiration pneumonia teramoto et al. 2008 baineet al. 2001. aspiration pneumonia is caused by bacteria or othercontaminants that enter the trachea because of decreased swallowingfunction i.e. deglutition reﬂex and cough reﬂex manabe et al.2015 which is common in the older adult ebihara et al. 2016 perryet al. 2001 li et al. 2015. therefore it is important to keep the oralcavities of older adults clean to prevent aspiration pneumonia. in addition eﬀective oral care can prevent intraoral diseases e.g. periodontal disease and dental caries and systemic diseases such as anginabrain infarction and diabetes that can be induced by intraoral disease.oral care preparations can improve quality of life for older adultslangmore et al. 1998 teramoto et al. 2015 especially if the preparations are easily handled and can be taken even by bedridden patients.methods used for oral care include tooth brushing mouthwashesand oral care supplements to control plaque derived from bacteria. indental caries some streptococcus mutans s. mutans produce insolubleglucan which various microorganisms adhere to and then generate acidand dissolve the tooth enamel leme et al. 2006 forssten et al. 2010.to prevent dental caries chlorhexidine has been used to decreaseplaque accumulation charles et al. 2004. however

many compounds with antimicrobial antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory activities and are acandidate for preparation of oral care products graham 1992.we recently developed a novel method for facile preparation oforally disintegrating tablets odts by microwave irradiation of wetmolded tablets containing mannitol sugar alcohol a polymeric disintegrant and water absorbent materials sano et al. 2011 sano et al.2013 sano et al. 2014. odts are designed to dissolve in a smallamount of water in the oral cavity to enable patients with dysphagia orrestricted water intake to swallow tablets. they represent one of themost patientfriendly dosage forms wade et al. 2012 pﬁster andghosh 2005. in our methodology the microwave irradiation led to theformation of water vapor which resulted in the expansion of the poresinside the tablets and the formation of new void networks. these newvoid networks allowed for the water to penetrate into the tablet moreeﬃciently and resulted in a decrease in their disintegration time. inaddition the formation of water vapor during the microwave irradiation also led to the dissolutionprecipitation of some of the mannitolparticles which resulted in the formation of new solid bridges. theformation of new solid bridges between the mannitol particles led to anincrease in the hardness of the tablets. taken together this new methodtherefore makes it possible to prepare odts with opposing physicochemical properties such as rapid disintegration time and enhancedhardness. in addition we developed orally disintegrating tea tabletsodtts containing powdered tea leaves. these odtts disintegratedwithin the oral cavity within 30 s tanaka et al. 2016. in a preliminaryevaluation of antibacterial activity against s. mutans an odtt extractgreatly inhibited bacterial growth compared with artiﬁcial saliva. asthe disintegrated particles are kept in the oral cavity for a long time theantimicrobial action is sustained and this should increase the therapeutic eﬀect for oral care. if we could give odtts mucoadhesiveproperties the powdered tea that disintegrates in the oral cavity wouldadhere to the oral mucosa and exhibit sustained antibacterial actionagainst oral microbial ﬂora and provide eﬃcient oral care fig. 1.in the present study we tried to make mucoadhesive orally disintegrating tea tablets by adding polysaccharides. polysaccharides contain many connected monosaccharides and have diﬀerent types ofbonding and molecular weights wüstenberg 2015. polysaccharidescontain hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and their thickening or gellingaction is determined by the type and concentration of these groupsdickinson 2003. they are used in a wide range of applications infoods cosmetics oral care products and medicines avachat et al.2011 nayak et al. 2014 datta and bandyopadhyay 2006. mucin themain component of oral mucosa reportedly strengthens interactionswith hydrogen bond donors in the solute and polysaccharides containing

weassumed that this was caused by aggregation of polysaccharide molecules by dehydration of saccharides and alcohols and by formation ofhigherorder networks by hydrogen bonding of saccharides and alcohols with polysaccharide molecules. from these results we consideredthat artiﬁcial saliva rapidly inﬁltrated into f5 in the 20 s and the tamarind gum dissolved. the adhesiveness was high in this case becausetamarind gum strongly bound to mucin via hydrogen bonding. guargum also had a high viscosity like tamarind gum but the adhesivenessof the tablet containing guar gum was not as high as that of f5. weconsidered that this diﬀerence was caused by the permeability of theodtts. a small air gap was observed in f4 and it had a disintegrationtime of 120 s fig. 3 so the permeability to f4 appeared to be lowerthan that of f5. therefore despite the high viscosity the amount ofguar gum dissolved was small and the adhesiveness of f4 was lowerthan that of f5. for the particle retention ratio although bonding between the pulverized tablet particles and the mucin layer was relativelyhigh fig. 2f f4 had a disintegration time of 120 s or more.in summary although there were no diﬀerences in the swellingdegree hardness and friability among the formulations f2 and f5quickly disintegrated within 30 s and f5 had high adhesiveness properties and a high particle retention ratio.3.1. evaluation of odtts containing polysaccharides 1 ww massfractionthe degree of swelling hardness friability disintegration timeadhesiveness and particle retention ratio results are shown in fig. 2.the degree of swelling did not diﬀer between formulations and allformulations swelled by about 1 mm fig. 2a. this suggests that whenthe wet tablet was microwave irradiated water vapor inside the tabletevaporated and the tablet swelled. suﬃcient swelling should shortenthe disintegration time. the results of our previous study showed thatswelling of over 0.2 mm was suﬃcient for shortening the disintegrationtime of odts sano et al. 2011. all formulations had hardness valuesof over 13 n fig. 2b which is suﬃcient hardness for a 5mm diametertablet tanaka et al. 2016. this is because the excipient dmannitolmelts at 168 c and forms strong particletoparticle bonds during microwave irradiation. in addition because of the high hardness thefriability was  1 in all formulations fig. 2c. however the disintegration times were more than 120 s for f3 f4 and f6 which contained carrageenan guar gum and pectin respectively fig. 2d. bycomparison f1 and f2 which contained gum arabic and f5 whichcontained with tamarind gum had disintegration times of  30 s. according to the food and drug administration odts should disintegratewithin 30 s fda 2008. the disintegration times of f1 f2 and f5satisﬁed this requirement.we also observed the surfaces of the tablets by sem fig. 3. manysmall voids diameter over 3 μm were observed in f1 f2 and f5whereas few voids were observed in f3 f4 and f6. generally as thenumber of voids increases the water permeation to the interior of thetablet increases and the disintegration time decreases kondo et al.2012. by contrast as the number of voids decreases the water permeation decreases and the disintegration time increases. therefore thedisintegration times indicate that f1 f2 and f5 have many voids andgood water permeation.among the tablets f5 showed the highest adhesiveness with themucin layer fig. 2e and f. the high adhesiveness of tamarind gummight be caused by its viscosity. we measured the viscosities of thepolysaccharides at 25 c and 80 c fig. 4. guar gum and tamarind3.2. eﬀect of the tamarind gum concentration on physicochemicalproperties of the odttsour results showed that odtts containing tamarind gum had goodhardness rapid disintegration and high adhesiveness. therefore weinvestigated the eﬀect of the tamarind gum mass fraction on physicochemical properties of the odtts. we measured the degree of swellinghardness friability disintegration time adhesiveness and particle retention ratio for tablets with tamarind gum mass fractions of 0.5 1 3and 5 ww fig. 5. for odtts with tamarind gum mass fractions of0.5 and 1 ww the degree of swelling was about 1 mm but as thetamarind gum mass fraction increased to 3 and 5 ww the degree ofswelling decreased to about 0.5 mm fig. 5a. this is because a gel wasformed in the tablet as the proportion of tamarind gum increased andeven though microwave irradiation was carried out the water vaporcould not suﬃciently expand the tablet. the hardness values were over13 n in all formulations fig. 5b. because of the high hardness allformulations had friability values of  1 fig. 5c which suggeststhat the hardness is enough. when the tamarind gum mass fraction was0.5 or 1 ww the disintegration time was  30 s fig. 5d howeveras the tamarind gum mass fraction increased the disintegration timeincreased to  60 s.when we observed the tablet surfaces by sem many voids wereobserved in odtts containing 0.5 and 1 ww mass fraction tamarind gum whereas hardly any voids were observed in odtts containing 3 and 5 ww mass fraction tamarind gum fig. 6. as discussed above with an increase in the viscosity of tamarind gum thesurface voids would disappear. this indicates that the lack of voidsprevents water permeation into the tablet and extends the disintegration time.the adhesive properties of the tablets increased as the mass fractionof tamarind gum increased fig. 5e. because of the increase in thetamarind gum mass fraction the viscosity increased and the bond withthe mucin layer became stronger. this increased the load and the adhesiveness increased. in addition as the mass fraction of tamarind gumincreased the particle retention ratio increased fig. 5f. it is thoughtthat as the content of tamarind gum bonded to the mucin layer increased the adhesiveness increased. therefore although an increase inthe mass fraction of tamarind gum tended to enhance the adhesivenessof the tablet addition of 1 ww tamarind gum produced tablets withsuﬃcient hardness disintegration and adhesiveness.fig. 4. viscosities of polysaccharides dissolved in a 1.68 m na2hpo4

the dissolution behavior of egcg which is an activecompound in tea leaves fig. 7. we examined its dissolution usingodtts containing 1 ww mass fraction tamarind gum and preparedwith microwave f5. these tablets showed rapid disintegration andhigh adhesiveness. in addition we carried out a dissolution test withpolysaccharidefree tablets without microwave f1without microwave odtts with microwave f1 and tablets containing 1 wwmass fraction tamarind gum without microwave f5without microwave. f1 showed the highest dissolution rate until 30 min and after1 h all tablets showed dissolution rates of almost 90. compared withf1 and f5 even with the addition of tamarind gum f5 showed a dissolution rate of 90 or more after 1 h. therefore addition of tamarindgum hardly aﬀected the dissolution rate of egcg. in addition3.4. quantitative analysis of catechinin addition to the dissolution study of egcg we extracted otheractive compounds from the tablets and performed quantitative analysesfor further antibacterial studies. the quantitative values for all compounds ecg gcg egc and egcg table 3 were lower after microwave treatment than before. this indicates that they were likelyconverted to other compounds by microwave irradiation or decomposed. however even when tamarind gum was added fast dissolutionwas observed compared with the tablet without tamarind gum. this7international journal of

was observed. in all formulations theabsorbances were markedly low and little bacterial growth was observed indicating that all formulations had growth inhibitory eﬀects.from the results of dissolution tests we found egcg had a dissolutionrate of 90 or more at 1 h fig. 7. therefore although the amounts ofthe active compound in f1 and f5 were a little bit lower than those intablets prepared without microwave irradiation suﬃcient egcg waspresent to show antibacterial activity. overall the slight diﬀerences oftotal amounts of egcg did not aﬀect the antibacterial properties. previously egcg have been reported to inhibit the formation of glucosyltransferases and bioﬁlms at 500 µgml koo et al. 2002 which issimilar to our results. we can conclude that polyphenols extracted

limitations hollow ﬁber protected liquidphase microextraction hflpme was introduced in 1999 13. inthe ﬁrst paper hflpme was utilized for preconcentration andextraction of pharmaceuticals prior to electrophoretic identiﬁcation and determination. an aqueous extraction solvent was injectedinto the lumen of a porous polypropylene hollow ﬁber membranewhile the porous wall was impregnated by an organic supportedliquid membrane slm. as the extraction solvent acceptor phasewas not in direct contact with the sample solution the extractionsystem was stable and highly efﬁcient sample cleanup was achieved with this innovative strategy. hflpme can be utilized forquantitative analysis from very complex environmental and biological samples 14.a typical hflpme setup consists of a porous hollow ﬁbermembrane made of polypropylene polytetraﬂuoroethylene andpolyvinylidene ﬂuoride which is impregnated with an organicsolvent. the solvent is immobilized in the pores in the wall of thehollow ﬁber membrane and serves as supported liquid membraneslm 15. the acceptor phase can be either an aqueous solution oran organic solvent. due to this ﬂexibility hflpme is compatiblewith most analytical instruments for chromatography electrophoresis molecular and atomic spectrometry and electrochemistry. the current review discusses recent applications of hfbasedmicroextraction for pharmaceutical and heavy metal applicationsand on their compatibility with different instrumental methods.2. principles and possible modes of the hflpmein hfbased lpme methods the extraction phase is placed in thelumen of a porous hollow ﬁber. in such a way the acceptor phase isprotected by the slm. to perform hflpme a polypropylene hollow ﬁber membrane may ﬁrst be sonicated in acetone to removepolymer impurities 16. then the hollow ﬁber membrane is soakedin an impregnating solvent to ﬁll the pores of the hf membrane bycapillary forces and excess solvent may be removed by washingwith distilled water 17. after this step the lumen of the hollowﬁber is ﬁlled with the acceptor phase. as is thoroughly discussedbelow the acceptor phase can be the same organic solvent as theslm the twophase mode or can be an aqueous solution thethreephase mode. finally the hollow ﬁber is immersed in thesample solution and the analytes are extracted from the samplethrough the slm and into the acceptor phase 18. four differentarrangements for hflpme have been reported i.e. rod like ushaped hollowﬁber solvent bar and knotted hollowﬁber.considering the physicochemical characteristics of the desiredanalytes and levels of complexity of the sample hflpme can beperformed in a two or threephase mode.2.1. twophase hflpmein twophase hflpme the pores in the wall of the hollow ﬁberand the lumen are ﬁlled with an organic solvent which is immiscible with the aqueous sample solution. solvents like 1octanol anddihexyl ether are commonly used 19. twophase hflpme isapplied for extraction and preconcentration of analytes with lowpolarity such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs. since theanalytes are extracted into an organic solvent twophase lpme iscompatible with gas chromatography. fig. 2 illustrates the principleof twophase hflpme. according to this the slm and the organicacceptor phase are the same in twophase hflpme.2.2. threephase hflpmein threephase lpme the pores in the wall of the hollow ﬁberare ﬁlled with an organic solvent immiscible with water while thelumen is ﬁlled with aqueous solution acceptor solution. 1octanoland dihexylether are common solvents 20. the mechanism ofextraction is based on ph adjustment of the sample solution andthe aqueous acceptor phase. for instance extraction of acidiccompounds is achieved by acidiﬁcation of the sample to suppressionization of the target analytes. this results in successful transferof analytes towards the acceptor phase through the organic slm.ph of the aqueous acceptor solution should be adjusted to a phvalue 2e3 units above pka of the analyte.carrier mediated threephase hflpme was introduced where ahydrophobic carrier was dissolved in the organic slm before theimpregnation of the hf pores 21. the applied carrier is an organiccompound capable of ionpairing with analytes of interest. henceat the contact region between the sample solution and the slm thedesired ionpair complexes are formed leading to successfulextraction of target analytes. at the contact region between theslm and the aqueous acceptor phase the analyte is exchanged withw.a. khan et al.  journal of pharmaceutical analysis 10 2020 109e122111fig. 2. a schematic mechanism of the twophase hflpme.a suitable inorganic counter ion dissolved in the acceptor solutionand is released into the acceptor solution.as mentioned threephase hflpme can be applied for ionizable compounds acids and bases. twophase hflpme offers highpfs and extraction efﬁciencies for nonpolar analytes. howeverbecause the slm and the acceptor phase are the same organicsolvent there is no phase boundary. therefore cleanup is limited.interestingly ghambarian et al. introduced a variant where ndodecane was used as the organic slm while organic solvents likemethanol ethanol or acetonitrile which are all immiscible with ndodecane were used as acceptor phase 22. this strategy providedimproved sample cleanup while extraction efﬁciency was notsacriﬁced. fig. 3 illustrates the principles of threephase hflpme.hflpme can be carried out through static dynamic and evenfully automated strategies. one of the most interesting approachesfor dynamic hflpme was introduced by esraﬁli et al. called ttextraction 23. between two t connectors a stainlesssteel tubewas mounted housing the hollow ﬁber membrane. the samplesolution was pumped into the ttextractor through the two tconnectors while the acceptor phase was injected into the hollowﬁber membrane via a syringe pump. this conﬁguration was capableof carrying out twophase hflpme. fig. 4 illustrates this innovative approach with all the details. in another strategy offered by thesame research group a fully automated hflpme with capabilityfor two and threephase hflpme procedures was developed. inthis setup a syringe pump was used for washing ﬁlling andejection of different solvents. four containers were used forwashing solvent slm extraction solvent and elution solvent. theextraction system was successfully connected with liquid chromatography. fig. 5 shows the graphical design of this hflpmeinstrument 24.2.3. electromembrane extractionin hflpme mass transfer is by passive diffusion and this resultsin relatively slow extraction kinetics. alternatively ionizable compounds can be extracted efﬁciently and with outstanding samplecleanup by electromembrane extraction eme 25. the principlefig.

similar to that of hflpme. however in eme the analytesare extracted selectively in their charged form under the inﬂuenceof an electrical ﬁeld. thus mass transfer is by electrokineticmigration across the slm and 2nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe isoften used as slm. the setup for eme is very similar to threephasehflpme but in eme two electrodes usually platinum wires areutilized. one electrode is placed in the acceptor phase into thehollow ﬁber lumen while the second electrode is inserted into thesample solution. fig. 6 shows the principle of eme.for extraction of basic analytes the cathode  is placed insidethe acceptor phase while for acidic analytes the direction of theelectrical ﬁeld is reversed 18. after extraction the acceptor phaseis collected with a microsyringe and injected into an analyticalinstrument for quantitative analysis. due to the electrical ﬁeldacross the slm bubble formation joule heating and even punctuation of slm may occur in eme systems operated under nonoptimal conditions. these phenomena occur in longer extractiontimes as a result of excessive migration of ions across slm. alsowhen the electrical ﬁeld is applied electrical double layers andlocal ph gradients are formed in the interfaces between the slmand the aqueous solutions on both side. these may impact the masstransfer. to reduce the impact of these phenomena application ofconstant direct electrical current and application of pulsed voltagehave been reported 26. although the utilization of a stabilized andconstant direct current improved the efﬁciency and stability ofeme this approach is still not common in eme publications. pulsedelectromembrane extraction peme was introduced as a strategyto enhance the efﬁciency of eme using a simple and inexpensiveextraction setup 27. pulsed voltage was found to improveextraction efﬁciency and system stability.3. operational parameters of hflpme and emethe type of hollowﬁber membrane type of extraction solventph of donor and acceptor phases extraction time stirring rate saltaddition and temperature are important parameters in hflpmeand eme. applied voltage and electrode material thickness anddistance are additional parameters affecting eme performance.w.a. khan et al.  journal of pharmaceutical analysis 10 2020 109e122113fig. 6. a schematic mechanism for electromembrane extraction.3.1. hollowﬁber membranethe porous wall of the hollowﬁber serves as support for theslm. the slm solvent should be of low polarity and immisciblewith water. for immobilization of such lowpolarity solvents thehollowﬁber should be of hydrophobic material 28. in most casespolypropylene hollowﬁber membranes have been used. suchhollowﬁbers are commercially available at a low price. thereforeeach hollowﬁber membrane is used only for a single extractionand is then discarded. alternatively polyvinylidene diﬂuoridehollowﬁber membranes can be used 14.3.2. supported liquid membrane slmthe solvent selected for the slm plays a major role for the stability and the efﬁciency of the extraction system both in hflpmeand eme. first the solvent should be nonvolatile in order toavoid evaporation and solvents with boiling point exceeding200  c are recommended. second the solvent should be immisciblewith water in order to avoid leakage to the sample. usually solventswith water solubility less than 0.5 mgml are recommended. thirdthe solvent should facilitate efﬁcient mass transfer of target analyte14. in hflpme high efﬁciency can often be obtained with a variety of organic solvents. common organic solvents for hflpmeinclude ndihexyl ether 1octanol dodecyl acetate and toluene.ionic liquids have also been used as slm solvent in hflpme 28. ineme the type of solvent used for the slm is much more critical29. this is due to the fact that analyte molecules are charged whenentering the organic slm and partition is voltage dependent.common organic solvents used in eme are 2enitrophenyloctylether npoe and 1octanol.3.3. sample and acceptor phsample and acceptor ph plays a major role both in hflpme andeme. in hflpme the analyte is extracted in neutral form into theslm while it is ionized in contact with the acceptor. therefore forextraction of basic analytes the sample should be alkaline whilethe acceptor should be acidic or neutral depending on analyte pkavalue. for hflpme of acidic analytes the ph gradient is reversedusing acidic conditions in the sample and alkaline or neutral conditions in the acceptor 3031. in eme the analytes are ionized inthe entire extraction system. thus for basic analytes both thesample and the acceptor are neutral or acidic. for acidic analyteseme is conducted with neutral or alkaline conditions in sample andacceptor 32. due to local ph effects 33 at the slm boundarylayers ph in the acceptor solution is critical in eme and for basicanalytes ph should be no less than three units above pka. inaddition ph may change in the sample and acceptor during emedue to electrolysis 34 and therefore buffers are recommended inboth sample and acceptor.3.4. extraction timeboth hflpme and eme are equilibrium techniques. this impliesthat extraction recovery increases rapidly versus time during initialextraction and after a certain period of time the systems enterequilibrium. thus from a theoretical point of view recovery isconstant from this point forward and extraction is terminated.equilibrium time is typically in the range 30e60 min for hflpmedepending on the chemical properties of the analytes and the geometry of the system 35. for eme equilibrium time is shorter dueto the electrokinetic mass transfer and ranges typically from 5 to15 min. in eme recoveries may drop during prolonged extractiondue to ph changes in sample and acceptor and due to instability ofthe slm 36.3.5. stirringagitationhflpme and eme are performed under stirring or agitationconditions. by such convection is induced in the sample and analyte mass transfer to the slm is facilitated. in addition stirring oragitation reduces the boundary layer thickness at the sampleslminterface and this is very important for efﬁcient mass transfer 31.the optimal stirring or agitation rate is geometry dependent and isnormally optimized during method development. typically stirring or agitation in the range 500e1000 rpm is used. at higherrates air bubbles are often formed and this can reduce extractionperformance 37.3.6. salt additionaddition of salt to the sample affects the efﬁciency of hflpmeand eme. in hflpme the addition of salt to the sample solution114w.a. khan et al.  journal of pharmaceutical analysis 10 2020 109e122often increases the extraction efﬁciency 3839. the increase inextraction efﬁciency is due to increased ionic strength in thesample which increases analyte partition into the organic slm.however negative effects of salt in the samples are also reported4041. this may be due to changes in the nernst diffusion ﬁlmcontrolling the diffusion rate of analytes into the acceptor phase4243. typical salt additions are 5e30 wv 44. in emeaddition of salt to the sample is normally not performed. for efﬁcient eme a low ion balance may be favorable under certain conditions 45e47. the ion balance is deﬁned as the ratio between thetotal amount of ions in the sample and the total amount of ions inthe acceptor phase.3.7. temperaturehflpme and eme are normally performed at room temperature. both extraction modes are affected by temperature. partitioncoefﬁcients decrease with the increase in temperature whilediffusion across the slm increases. temperatures up to 40 c havebeen used but above this temperature slms tend to be less stable3748.3.8. electrodes emeplatinum is normally used as inert electrode material in eme.the electrode thickness plays a key role in eme. the internaldiameter of the electrodes should be substantially less than theinner diameter of the hollow ﬁber in order not to displace acceptorphase. the distance between the electrodes is another importantparameter 49.3.9. applied voltage emegenerally the extraction efﬁciency in eme increases with theincreasing voltage up to a certain level. above this there is nofurther gain in extraction efﬁciency and mass transfer is no longerlimited by the voltage. voltages applied in eme normally rangefrom 5 to 300 v. voltages exceeding 300 v are not recommendeddue to instability of the extraction system and generation of gasbubbles electrolysis 37.microﬂuidic paperbased analytical device mpad for extractionof cr vi. the membrane was impregnated in a mixture of aliquat336 and

analysis of heavy metalshighly conjugated organic compounds and biological macromolecules due to easy availability simplicity versatility speed accuracyprecision and costeffectiveness. however in complex samples theanalytes cannot be measured directly with a uvevisible spectrophotometer due to low concentration. therefore a sample preparation step is necessary to improve selectivity and sensitivity.atikarnsakul et al. presented an eme procedure for preconcentration and extraction of crvi. polypropylene hollow ﬁber membranewas impregnated with npoe and used for eme. for

interface enhanced the transport ofmetalcomplex ion through the membrane. bathwater of chromeplating industry was used as real sample for analysis to check theselectivity of calix 4arene towards crvi

environmental clinical and biological samplespetroleum products pharmaceuticals and in food 50. the hollowﬁber based techniques coupled with atomic spectrometric techniques for preconcentration and determination of different heavymetals are summarized in table 1 51e60. hflpme has beencoupled to ﬂame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas andgraphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas formetal analysis 51e55. in one example tahmasebi et al. introduced a new approach to the extraction of cr vi based on emecoupled with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometryetaas. before using the hollow ﬁber membrane as slm polyaniline nanoparticles were coated on the surface to increase theselectivity for the extraction of crvi. the polyaniline reinforcedhollow ﬁber selectively extracted cr vi from real samples viaanion exchange. the surface area of the nanostructure coated polyaniline increased the preconcentration of the target analyte 56.in another example alahmad et al. introduced an hflpme4.2.1. high performance liquid chromatography hplcthreephase hflpme and eme are ideal for acidic and basicdrugs. in threephase hflpme the acceptor phase is an aqueoussolution and this can be injected directly into hplc systemswithout previous evaporation and reconstitution 30. for extraction of basic analytes in hflpme ph of donor phase must be keptalkaline to suppress the ionization and solubility of the analytewhereas ph for acceptor phase should be acidic. in case of acidicanalytes the ph gradient across the slm is reversed 3031. forextraction of basic analytes in eme ph of donor and acceptorphases are kept acidic to ionize the analytes. the anode is placed inthe donor phase while the cathode is placed in the acceptor phaseto facilitate the migration of analyte. in case of acidic analytes thedonor and acceptor phases are made alkaline and the direction ofthe electrical ﬁeld is reversed 3032. threephase systems providebetter degree of cleanup than two phase systems due to the factthat most water soluble components do not pass through the slm.khan et al. presented a new strategy for selective and simultaneous extraction of three drugs with different hydrophobicityproperty. the eme process was carried out in a microﬂuidic chipdevice. the microﬂuidic device consisted of three pmma plateshaving m shaped microchannels. the middle pmma plate provideda

emepreconcentration of basic drugs. in this experiment it wasconcluded that the transfer of analytes across the membrane is119inversely proportional to the membrane thickness. recent studiesof eme and hflpme coupled with ce are mentioned in table 3113e124.4.2.4. voltammetryone of the most important and widely used electroanalyticaltechniques is voltammetry 133 and for quantiﬁcation of heavymetals anodic stripping voltammetry asv has been combinedwith hflpme. the major advantage of asv over other voltammetric techniques is the step of preconcentration onto the electrode surface 134. anodic stripping voltammetry has lowdetection limits high sensitivity and selectivity as compared toother electrochemical techniques. detection limits with anodicstripping voltammetry of heavy metals are in the ppm range 135.to the best of our knowledge 2017 to may2019 there is only oneresearch article on voltammetric instrumental technique forquantiﬁcation of heavy metals using hflpme or eme preconcentration. for pharmaceuticals several new approaches based onhollow ﬁber based techniques have been reported. in one examplehrdlicka et al. presented an hflpme method for extraction anddetermination of vanillylmandelic acid combined with dpv. in thisstudy a 20 mm polypropylene hollow ﬁber membrane was soakedin an organic solvent to impregnate the pores. the excess organicsolvent was removed by air with a syringe. the lumen of the ﬁberwas ﬁlled with acceptor phase and sealed in both ends. the prepared membrane was fully immersed in sample solution and stirred with a magnetic bar. after eme the acceptor phase wascollected and transferred to the surface of working electrode fordpv analysis 131.tahmasebi et al. reported a novel approach in eme for preconcentration and determination of propylthiouracil coupled withdpv. cunps were synthesized for selective extraction of propylthiouracil and coated on hollow ﬁber membrane. the coated cunpsincreased mass transfer and selectivity of propylthiouracil due tothe high selectivity of cunps toward thiol groupsulfhydryl compounds. the high afﬁnityselectivity of propylthiouracil towardscunps was explained by the hard and soft acidbase theory. it wasconcluded that nitrobenzene was the best choice for propylthiouracil extraction because alcoholic solvents such as 1octanol and2ethylhexanol dissolved cunps. it was pointed out that thisapproach was not applicable for acidic compounds 129. researchcombining hflpme and eme with voltammetry is summarized intable 3 125e131.5. conclusions and looking into the futuresince 1999 a larger number of reports have been published onthe development of hflpme. these efforts have documented hflpme as a green sample preparation technique requiring only afew microliters of organic solvent per sample. hflpme enableshigh enrichment and excellent sample cleanup from biological andenvironmental samples. in the threephase mode hflpme provides aqueous extracts which are directly injectable in hplc. due tothe protection of the acceptor phase by the slm hflpme isamenable to highly complex samples such as plasma whole bloodurine saliva breast milk tap water surface water pond waterseawater and soil slurries. hflpme shows great potential forroutine applications but to enter this area commercial productsand automation are required. also generic methods have to bedeveloped to simplify method development.eme has been developed in parallel to hflpme but eme is lessmature. although eme provides the same advantages as hflpmethe electrical ﬁeld open for additional perspectives. thus theextraction is controlled by an external electrical ﬁeld and selectivity may be tuned by the direction and magnitude of the electrical120w.a. khan et al.  journal of pharmaceutical analysis 10 2020 109e122ﬁeld by the chemical composition of the slm and by ph in sampleand acceptor phase.both hflpme and eme are highly efﬁcient for extraction ofheavy metals and pharmaceuticals. the techniques are compatiblewith a broad spectrum of chromatographic spectroscopic andelectroanalytical techniques. future work should focus on automation and commercialization. in addition the future may seeresearch on the use of green solvents and slms modiﬁed withmetal nanoparticles mnps and carbon nanotubes cnts whichmay increase the extraction efﬁciency of targeted analytes.conﬂicts of interestthe

Abstract
Background and purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) effect of 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline compounds. Moreover, molecular docking study of the
compounds into the active site of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) as a necessary enzyme for the
vitality of apicoplast was carried out.
Experimental approach: A number of 5-oxo-hexahydoquinoline derivatives (Z1-Z4) were synthesized. The
T. gondii tachyzoites of RH strain were treated by different concentrations (1-64 μg/mL) of the compounds.
The viability of the encountered parasites with compounds was assessed using flow cytometry and propidium
iodide (PI) staining. Due to the high mortality effect of Z3 and Z4 in vitro, their chemotherapy effect was
assessed by inoculation of tachyzoites to four BALB/c mice groups (n = 5), followed by the gavage of various
concentrations of the compounds to the mice. Molecular docking was done to study the binding affinity of the
synthesized 5-oxo-hexahydroquinolines into ENR enzyme active site byusing AutoDock Vina® software.
Docking was performed by a Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm with 100 runs.
Findings / Results: Flow cytometry assay results indicated compounds Z3 and Z4 had relevant mortality effect
on parasite tachyzoites. Besides, in vivo experiments were also performed and a partial increase of mice
longevity between control and experiment groups was recorded. Molecular docking of Z3 and Z4 in the binding
site of ENR enzyme indicated that the compounds were well accommodated within the binding site. Therefore,
it could be suggested that these compounds may exert their anti-T. gondii activity through the inhibition of the
ENR enzyme.
Conclusion and implications: Compounds Z3 and Z4 are good leads in order to develop better anti-T. gondii
agents as they demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects on tachyzoites viability and infection.
Further studies on altering the route of administration along with additional pharmacokinetics evaluations are
needed to improve the anti-T. gondii impacts of 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline compounds.

Introduction
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an
intracellular protozoan parasite which causes
toxoplasmosis, a common zoonotic infection in
humans and animals (1). The estimation
indicates that disease prevalence rate in humans
is one-third of the world population people who


have been chronically infected. The parasite
engenders severe medical complications
in the fetus and also immunocompromised
people (2, 3).
Moreover, despite of the relatively low rate of
toxoplasmosis outbreak in immunocompetent
ones, some studies report severe toxoplasmosis
in healthy patients (4, 5). T. gondii is
transmitted by felids, whereas their coccidian
lifestyle through sexual reproduction leads to
pouring oocysts in outside of their bodies (6-8).
Rodents and other intermediate hosts may
ingest oocysts, bringing about the initial
expansion of growing tachyzoites and thus
disseminating to all over the body which leads
to acute infection of the parasite. In response to
tachyzoites attack throughout the body, the
immune reaction of the intermediate host's
body occurs, and then parasite converts into the
recumbent and slow-growing form of the
parasite called the bradyzoite (9). Finally, the
ingestion of raw meats or water involving
oocysts causes infection in humans.
The conventional treatment of
toxoplasmosis in humans comprises of a
combination of drugs of sulfadiazine (blocks
dihydropteroate synthetase) and pyrimethamine
(or trimethoprime which inhibits dihydrofolate
reductase) (10). T. gondii first disseminates as
tachyzoites then resides in tissue cysts
causing a prolonged latent infection. In
immunocompromised patients, bradyzoites can
turn into tachyzoites that may cause pneumonia
and encephalitis. Despite all advancements in
drug discovery, encysted bradyzoites have not
been yet destroyed by suitable drugs (11).
Quinolines are a group of heterocyclic
aromatic organic compounds with a multitude
of medicinal properties (12-15). Quinoline ring
and one of its derivatives, 2-methyl-3carbethoxyquinoline, were eligible to inhibit
the T. gondii growth, 52-57% loss of a unique
non-photosynthetic organelle of T. gondii
tachyzoites called apicoplast (16). The
synthesis of heme, isoprenoid precursors and
fatty-acid synthesis (FAS) II pathway is done
within this particular organelle(17,18). The
enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) is
among the specific enzymes FAS II pathway,
the final and integral stage in the fatty acid
chain elongation (17). Attempts have far
revealed the vulnerability of a host of T. gondii
to inhibition of fatty acids pathway and ENR
subsequently by triclosan (19,20). As to
compare with previous studies, quinoline

derived drugs such as 4-aminoquinolines
and 8-amino quinolines were more efficacious
in treating malaria disease than revealing
inhibition effect on T. gondii growth. On the
other hand, benzylquine and bisquinoline were
among the promising compounds against
T. gondii with EC50 values less than 1 μM, in
comparison with other candidates that have
been used in the study which killed less
T. gondii (21). Another research showed that
endochin-like quinolone can reduce brain
T. gondii tissue cyst numbers in mice due to
inhibition of T. gondii cytochrome bc1 function
(22). A review study reveals that the quinoline
ring has anti-T. gondii activity through
mechanisms of heme polymerization and
degradation in the food vacuole, membrane
transport interruption in the parasite (19), can
disrupt apicoplast DNA and finally the whole
apicoplast in the parasite (16,23).
Regarding quinoline derivatives biological
effects,
we
synthesized
5-oxohexahydroquinoline analogs bearing different
aromatic substitutions at C4 while, having
different pyridyl alkyl carboxylates at C3
(Fig. 1) and evaluated them for their in vitro and
in vivo inhibitory effects on the viability and
infectivity of Toxoplasma tachyzoites.

Alternatively,
5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline
derivatives were obtained by the reaction
among oxobutanoate (2a, 2b, or 2c),
corresponding aromatic aldehyde (2 mmol) and
1,3-cyclohexanedione (2 mmol) in the presence
of ammonium acetate (10 mmol) in ethanol
(7 mL) for 8 h, while protected from light
(Fig. 2) (15). The reaction was monitored by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Ethanol was
removed under reduced pressure and the
residue was dissolved in chloroform. Then the
reaction mixture was purified by TLC with
chloroform-ethanol as the mobile phase.
Finally, the product was recrystallized from the
proper solvent to yield pure compounds
(Fig. 2). All the molecular structures of final
products were classified and confirmed by
IR, 1H NMR, mass spectrometry (MS), and
elemental analysis. Chemical structures and
physical properties of the synthesized
compounds are shown in Table 1
Chemicals
Analytical degree chemicals and solvents
were used in this experiment. Pyridine-2-ylmethanol, pyridine-3-yl-methanol, pyridine-3ylpropanol,
aldehydes,
and
1,3cyclohexanedione were provided from Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany. Propidium iodide (PI)
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA.
Apparatuses
Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
13
( C NMR) and proton (1H) NMR spectra were
detected with a Brucker 300 spectrometer.
Infrared (IR) spectra were acquired on a PerkinElmer spectrometer (KBr disk) (Perkin-Elmer,
Waltham, MA). Chemical shifts were reported
as ppm and tetramethylsilane was used as an
internal standard. Mass spectra (MS) were
recorded with an Agilent spectrometer (Agilent
technologies 9575c inert MSD, USA). A
Costech elemental analysis instrument
(Costech ESC 4010, Italy) was achieved as the
elemental assessment and was within 0.4 % of
the calculated value. A hot stage apparatus
(Electrothermal, Essex, UK) was used to attain
melting points.

Biological activity procedures
Animals
Inbred BALB/c mice aging 6-8 weeks, and
weighing 25-27 g were purchased from Pasteur
Institute, Tehran, I.R. Iran. The whole procedures
of trials and sacrifices were identical for all
animals. In the course of the experiments,
starting from November 2017 and ending up to
February 2018, animals were maintained at
22 °C with about 40-50% relative humidity, and
also standard food and water ad libitum were
available. The in vivo study was conducted
based on the laboratory animal’s guidelines in
literary and research disciplines (24).

Synthesis

Parasites
The virulent T. gondii RH strain was
provided from Tehran University of Medical
Sciences, Tehran, I.R. Iran. T. gondii
Tachyzoites were taken by a serial
intraperitoneal passage in BALB/c inbred mice
and then they were collected 72 h after the
inoculation of 106 parasites in the mice, by
repeated flushing in the peritoneal cavity using
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a pH of 7.2.
Next, tachyzoites were harvested and
centrifuged for 10 min at 200 g at 25 °C to
eliminate the peritoneal cells and cellular
debris. The supernatant was then gathered and
centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 rpm (800 g) (25).

at 4 °C. Then, the tachyzoites were gathered in
Eppendorf tubes staining with 50 μg/mL
concentration of PI for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally,
the parasites were preserved on ice and in dark
condition until analysis. Positive controls were
obtained by incubation of the parasites in the
vicinity of 0.2% saponin. The cell suspension
was transferred into polystyrene flow
cytometry tubes (BD Falcon, USA). Data
achievement and evaluation were performed
with a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, San Jose, USA) and Cell Quest Pro
software (25).
Chemotherapy effect of the compounds
A number of 2 × 105 tachyzoites were
subcutaneously inoculated into 5 groups, 5
mices in each group, including three
concentrations (16, 32, 64 μg/mL) of
compounds Z3, Z4.The other groups were
negative and positive control (Sufadiazine 4
μg/mL). Based on IC50 determination study of
compounds Z3, Z4, these compounds were

Extracellular viability assay (flow cytometry)
Compounds Z1-Z4 were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to attain a 10 mM
stock solution. The tachyzoites (2 × 105/mL of
PBS) were treated with DMSO (0.1% v/v) as
the control and various concentrations (1-64
μg/mL) of 5-oxo-hexahydroquinolines for 2 h

selected for chemotherapy in mice. Toxicity
assessment of compounds Z3 and Z4 was
performed in the 6th group of mice; the
compounds were orally gavaged into mice that
have not been inoculated by the intact parasites.
For the negative control, the mice only have
been inoculated with parasites. Sulfadiazine
(15 mg/kg) as an active substance was orally
administered against T. gondii in the positive
control group.

resulting from docking was ranked due to the
free energy of the interactions of ligandreceptors. Validation of molecular docking was
done by extracting the structure of the
cocrystallized ligand and re-docking it into the
receptor (self-docking). The root mean square
deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate,
optimize, and validate the docking calculations.
We investigated the binding affinities of the
synthesized 5-oxo-hexahydroquinolines into
ENR enzyme active site. The docking process
used a Lamarckian genetic algorithm with 100
runs for each ligand, leaving other parameters
at their default measures (28). Conformations
were clustered and ranked by the energy. The
conformation with the best-scored pose and the
lowest binding energy was selected. The
docking results were depicted using
ChemOffice software.

Molecular docking analysis
The 3D structures of the synthesized
compounds were sketched using ChemOffice
software (26) Then, the achieved structures
were optimized in their conformation by the
energy minimization process, in which the
results were saved in pdb formats. After energy
optimization and ligand preparation, the
Gastiger’s partial charges and the number of
torque’s angles of molecules were calculated.
The ligands were also saved in pdbqt formats.
In this study, we applied AutoDock Vina
software to inquire about the affinity and
binding modes of the synthesized derivatives to
the binding pocket of P-gp. X-ray crystal
structure of Enoyl-acyl Carrier Protein
Reductase (Enoyl ACP Reductase) in complex
with triclosan and NAD (PDB ID: 2O2S) was
got from RCSB Protein Data Bank
(http://www.rcsb.org). To prepare the enzyme
for docking, we removed the innate ligand and
water molecules, added hydrogen atoms,
merged non-polar hydrogens, and added
Gasteiger charges. All rotatable bonds of
ligands, defined by default of the program, were
allowed to rotate during the automated docking
process, and then prepared protein and ligand
structures were saved in the PDBQT format
suitable for calculating energy grid maps. Auto
Dock Tools were used to prepare the molecules
and parameters before submitting it for docking
analysis with Auto Dock (27). The grid
dimensions were 30 × 30 × 30 Å along with a
grid space value of 1 Å. The grid was centered
at 3.177, 67.997, and 67.535 Å (X, Y, and Z)
which involved the active site of triclosan. It is
notable to say that macromolecule sequences
were considered rigid and inflexible. Besides,
the exhaustiveness factor was considered “8”,
and then each of the conformational structures

Statistical analysis
Data analysis was done by FACS Calibur flow,
Cell Quest Pro software and SPSS software
(version 22, Armonk, NY, USA) using the one
way ANOVA test as appropriate. Intergroup
comparisons were undertaken using Tukey’s
posthoc test, after log transformation for nonparametrically distributed variables. 𝑃 ≤ 0.05
was contemplated statistically significant.

Z4 were 7.8, 9.1 and 9.6, respectively, while,
the mean survival of the mice in the negative

showed a correlation between Z3 and

was validated by extracting the structure of the

Endochin-like quinolone structure was also
previously surveyed for its potential use in
clinics. The relevant results revealed that two of
endochin-like derivatives were remarkably
successful in the inhibition of acute and latent
murine toxoplasmosis. Inhibition of the
cytochrome bc1 complex in the parasites was
suggested as a reason for this outstanding effect
(22). Moreover, the other quinolone that reported
to be effective against toxoplasmosis was
enrofloxacin, which was better than sulfadiazine
(as a strong anti-T. gondii compound) to protect
human foreskin fibroblasts infected cells against
T. gondii. Enrofloxacin proved to be an active
compound for cleaning up the tissue parasites as
well as it could alleviate the brain
inflammations of T. gondii’s infected Calomys
callosus. In addition, the reduction percentage
of intracellular replication during the usage of
enrofloxacin was more than sulfadiazine (30).
Another research that was based on the
combination of enrofloxacin and toltrazuril,
resulted killing a significant number of parasites
and entirely broking down the tachyzoite
structure (31). Gatifloxacin, as a fluoroquinolone,
has ultimately inhibited human foreskin
fibroblasts T. gondii intracellular replication,
therefore leads to increase the T. gondii's
infected mice survival, and it has protected the
mice against acute toxoplasmosis. As like as
enrofloxacin, a synergistic effect, in vitro and in
vivo, was observed by using gatifloxacin along
with pyrimethamine. Moreover, juxtaposing
infected mice associated with concurrent use of
gatifloxacin and interferon gamma demonstrates
appropriate effect of the drugs which was much
higher than using them separated (32). In vivo
study of several quinolone derivatives against
acute and latent toxoplasmosis showed that two
of the compounds had ED50 values of 0.14 and
0.08 mg/kg in comparison with atovaquone
having an ED50 value of 0.85 mg/kg (22). In our
study, 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives
were evaluated for their anti-T. gondii effects.
Reviewing the literature of quinoline derivatives
in the previous studies, two compounds were
analyzed and proved to be active agents against T.
gondii with EC50 value of 0.03 mg/kg.
Furthermore, they had an inhibitory effect on
Plasmodium falciparum regarding the
mitochondrial electron transport mechanism, a
necessary phase of pyrimidines synthesis (33).

RMSD between the best conformation of the
native ligand docked into the binding site of
T. gondii ENR and the experimental one was
0.51 Å (Fig. 5). Binding interactions of the
synthesized derivatives established H-bonding
and H-Pi interactions with different amino acids
including Gly131, Ala231, Asn130, Ala129,
Lys237, and Arg230 (Table 3). Compounds Z3
and Z4 possessed the most negative binding free
energies (-8.5 and -9.2 kcal/mol) which were
comparable to that of the innate ligand
(-9.1 kcal/mol), were well accumulated in the
binding pocket of ENR by making hydrogen
bonds. The binding model of Z3 and Z4 is
illustrated in Fig. 6. In the two active
compounds (Z3 and Z4) a key hydrogen bond
interaction could be seen between NH of the
hexahydroquinolinone ring and Ala129. It
seems that the residue Ala129 played a crucial
role in making stable ligand-protein complexes.
Discussion
5-Oxo-hexahydroquinoline
compounds
synthesis and evaluation were done to assess
their anti-T. gondii effects. Flow cytometry
results using PI staining on T. gondii
extracellular tachyzoites indicated that
compound Z3 (baering 2-pyridyl methyl
carboxylate and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl at
C3 and C4) and Z4 (containing 23-pyridyl propyl
carboxylate and 4-methoxyphenyl moiety at
C3 and C4) are potential substances to exert antiT. gondii effects. Treating toxoplasmosis has some difficulties, such as adverse effects of
currently available drugs, which could be
resolved by looking for novel compounds with
new effective mechanisms. One other major
problem to address is the treatment of
immunocompromised patients, which can be
complicated due to their latent period.
Furthermore, rising microbial resistance is also
very challenging; therefore, developing new
effective drugs that are devoid of previous
problems are of great importance. A number of
studies were conducted on quinolone derivatives
evaluation. By way of example, an study showed
that 1-hydroxyquinolones inhibited the growth of
T. gondii by means of pyrimidine starvation
associated with the ATP depletion in
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase pathway (29).

4-Aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline
derivatives such as tafenoquine were safer than
primaquine, they are utilizing to prevent the
relapse of Plasmodium vivax as well, but these
compounds were ineffective against T. gondii
eventually (34). Another study that was
conducted on the effects of quinolone-like
compounds on T. gondii indicated that
quinolone has less EC50 than atovaquone, at the
same time, the quinolone-like compounds were
among the ones with higher EC50 amounts than
other common drugs in toxoplasmosis
treatment (21). A survey on the effect of
8-hydroxyquinoline compounds as anti-T.
gondii agents showed that 58 derivatives of
these compounds containing one or two
quinoline rings had very high effects (16). In
the present study, the most active compounds
(Z3 and Z4) were evaluated for their anti-T.
gondii activity in mice at three different
concentrations. in vivo results showed
significant statistical differences between all
doses of both compounds and the negative
control group (P ≤ 0.05) except the compound
Z3 at 16 μg/mL, the mean longevity was
increased compared to the negative control
group. Besides, toxicity effects were also
analyzed, and the mice which were
administered the highest dose (64 μg/mL) of
compound Z3 and Z4 showed no signs of a
certain amount of toxicity (weight loss, ruffled
fur, inactivity and so forth). Biologically,
T. gondii and the other Apicomplexa family
parasites have an essential organelle for parasite
living which is called apicoplast. FAS pathway
is of utmost importance mechanism in the
apicoplast. The FAS process in mammalians is
type I, but in Apicomplexa parasites is type II.
The fatty acid production in microorganisms is
well studied, it helped scientists to discover
relevant enzymes and substrates. Review studies
show the key role of FAS II pathway inhibition in
pathogen mortality (35,36). FAS comprised of 4
stages of compression, reduction, hydration, and
elongation, respectively. Elongation is the most
important stage of the process that is catalyzed by
ENR (37). ENR reduces the double bond between
acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA in associated with
NADH cofactor. Studies demonstrated that ENR
is of great necessity for FAS (38,39). Drugs such
as isoniazid, triclosan, diaborazine derivatives,
and aminopyridine inhibitors are able to inhibit

this enzyme in bacteria, triclosan certainly
inhibits FAS in both T. gondii and Plasmodium
falciparum (18,39). As previously mentioned,
the quinolone derivatives were among the antiT. gondii apicoplast agents. Thus, the ENR
enzyme within the apicoplast of the parasite
provided us a chance to assess the
hexahydroquinoline
based
compounds
inhibition effect on the FAS process (23). These
results propose using hexahydroquinoline
derivatives with a similar structure to quinolone
might exert anti-T. gondii effects. Back to our
study, docking results of the 5-oxohexahydroquinolines showed that compound Z3
and Z4 was well located within the active site of
T. gondii ENR enzyme and possessed the least
estimated free energy of binding compared to
the innate ligand. In addition, the correlation
between biological activities and the binding
affinities anticipated by AutoDock Vina®
modeling was appropriate for compound Z3 and
Z4. Therefore, it is suggested that this
compound may exert its anti-T. gondii activity
through the inhibition of the ENR enzyme.
Several studies surveyed ENR, for instance, in
one study isoxazole-3-carboxamides, 4hydroxypyridine-2(1H)-ones,
and
3aminopyrazoles were considered the best
inhibitors of ENR. However, this is not the only
enzyme that should be inhibited and other
mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis should be
blocked as well to kill tachyzoites (19). The
result of infectivity test on tachyzoites indicated
that compound Z3 and Z4 prolonged the life
duration of mice groups inoculated by
Toxoplasma tachyzoites more effectively than
negative control group; moreover, considrable
statistical differences were observed between
the compounds of intrest and the control group.
Docking
results
of
the
5-oxohexahydroquinolines exposed that compounds
Z4 and Z3 well located within the active site of
T. gondii ENR enzyme and possessed the most
negative estimated free energies of binding
comparable to the innate ligand. In addition, the
correlation between biological activities and the
binding affinities predicted by AutoDock
modeling was highly good for some compounds.
Therefore, it could be suggested that these
compounds may exert their anti-T. gondii activity
through the inhibition of the ENR enzyme.

CONCLUSION
5-Oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives have
been synthesized and evaluated for their anti-T.
gondii activities. In conclusion, 5-oxohexahydroquinoline seems to be an attractive
scaffold in this field and provides the context of
further research for lead optimization and drug
discovery. Compounds Z3 (baering 2-pyridyl
methyl carboxylate and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl
at C3 and C4) and Z4 (containing 23-pyridyl
propyl carboxylate and 4-methoxyphenyl moiety
at C3 and C4) are good leads in order to develop
better anti-T. gondii agents as they demonstrated
both in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects on
tachyzoites viability and infection.

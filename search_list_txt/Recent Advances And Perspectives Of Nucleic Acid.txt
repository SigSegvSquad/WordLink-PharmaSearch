The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a great threat to
global public health. Therefore, rapid and accurate identiﬁcation of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in
selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to
establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to
prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard
test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Isothermal nucleic acid ampliﬁcation is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its
fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the
currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist
researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.

Introduction
The ﬁght against infectious diseases caused by viruses remains a
challenging and endless task despite the tremendous efforts and
signiﬁcant advances in public healthcare. Infectious diseases pose a
signiﬁcant risk to human health and have led to approximately onefourth of deaths worldwide [1,2]. Coronaviruses belong to the family
of Coronaviridae and may cause respiratory and neurological diseases [3]. Until now, six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been
identiﬁed, namely, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoVNL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4].
In particular, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV once caused pandemic [5].
Recently, the emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
been challenging the global public health community to confront a
novel infectious disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). As of
22 February 2020, there were 77,816 conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19

and 2012 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). In
this epidemic, the detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were shown to be
useful for the early diagnosis of COVID-19, which would be beneﬁcial to controling the sources of infection and help patients to
prevent the illness progression. The rapid and accurate detection of
coronavirus is therefore becoming increasingly important.
With the advance in molecular biology technology, nucleic acid
detection methods have developed rapidly and become a revolutionary technology for virus detection. Especially, the method
based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is characterized by rapid
detection, high sensitivity and speciﬁcity, which has been regarded
as the "gold standard" for virus detection. Novel PCR-based
methods also have been reported to enhance both the speciﬁcity
and sensitivity of the assay. Besides, several molecular tests which
employ non-PCR-based methods, such as isothermal nucleic acid
ampliﬁcation (loop mediated isothermal ampliﬁcation (LAMP) and
nucleic acid sequence-based ampliﬁcation), were developed for the
detection of coronavirus RNA. In this work, we reviewed various
approaches currently available for detection of coronavirus. It is
anticipated that this will assist researchers to develop rapid and
accurate detection techniques.

2. PCR-based methods
PCR is an enzymatic method to produce numerous copies of a gene
by separating the two strands of the DNA containing the gene
segment, marking its location with a primer, and using a DNA polymerase to assemble a copy alongside each segment and continuously
copy the copies. It is widely used to amplify minute quantities of
biologic materials so as to provide adequate specimens for laboratory
study. Owing to its large range of applications, high sensitivity and
high sequence speciﬁcity, the PCR-based method has become a
routine and reliable technique for detecting coronaviruses [6,7].
Generally, coronavirus RNA is transferred into cDNA by reverse
transcription. Afterwards, the PCR is performed and followed by the
detection of PCR product through speciﬁc detection methods or instruments. Among these, gel visualization and sequencing after PCR
are the conventional methods for the detection of coronaviruses [8,9].
However, due to its time-consuming process and high cost, these
methods are not commonly used in clinical samples.
Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) detection is
currently favored for the detection of coronavirus because of its advantages as a speciﬁc, and simple quantitative assay. Moreover, realtime RT-PCR is more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay,
which helps much for the diagnosis in early infection [10,11]. Therefore, the real-time RT-PCR assay still is a predominant method to be
applied for the detection of all kinds of coronaviruses [12,13],
including SARS-CoV-2 [14].
Even so, massive efforts are invested to improve the real-time
RT-PCR assay. Since the RT-PCR methods are prone to contamination and require time-consuming sample handling and post-PCR
analysis, van Elden et al. [15] described a TaqMan-based real-time
RT-PCR that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic
setting for the detection of HCoV. Moreover, to further improve the
sensitivity, Yip et al. [16] designed a real-time quantitative RT-PCR
assay for SARS-CoV with the use of 2 TaqMan probes, instead of 1
probe. This simple modiﬁcation using dual TaqMan probes for
quantiﬁcation has wide applications in areas in which ultrasensitivity is critically required, with the SARS-CoV detection limit
of 1 copy RNA per reaction.
In clinical detection, the lack of safe and stable external positive
controls (EPC) could become a serious problem in the diagnosis of
coronavirus and plenty of attention has been focused to address this
problem. However, such problems could be well avoided in real-time
RT-PCR assays where EPC is an important component. Yu et al. [17]
developed a real-time RT-PCR assay in which the armored RNA was
used as EPC to detect the SARS-CoV, with a detection limit of 10
copies/mL. Meanwhile, the rapidly mutating nature of coronaviruses
highlights the need for accurate detection of genetically diverse
coronaviruses. Therefore, to improve the ability to detect coronavirus
precisely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results caused
by genome sequence variations, researchers have established
multiplex real-time RT-PCR methods with favorable sensitivity for
multitarget detection of coronavirus. Hadjinicolaou et al. [18]
developed a real-time RT-PCR assay using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. The assay incorporated four beacons, targeting
four genes in addition to an internal positive control. It was validated
using clinical samples, which exhibited target detection ability and
speciﬁcity with detection limit of 5 copies per reaction.
3. Isothermal nucleic acid ampliﬁcation-based methods
3.1. Regular LAMP-based methods
The LAMP is a novel isothermal nucleic acid ampliﬁcation
method with high efﬁciency. It is commonly used for the

ampliﬁcation of DNAs and RNAs, which exhibits great sensitivity
and high speciﬁcity as a result of its exponential ampliﬁcation
feature and 6 different target sequences identiﬁed by 4 different
primers simultaneously, respectively [19]. The LAMP assay is rapid
and does not require expensive reagents or instruments. Therefore,
the application of LAMP test might help to reduce the cost for
detection of coronavirus [20]. Herein, a number of LAMP-based
coronavirus detection methods have been developed and applied
in clinical diagnosis.
Gel electrophoresis is commonly used to analyze the ampliﬁed
products for an endpoint detection. Poon et al. [21] reported a simple
LAMP assay for SARS diagnosis and demonstrated the feasibility of
using this technology for detection of SARS-CoV. The ORF1b region of
SARS-CoV was chosen for SARS diagnosis and ampliﬁed by LAMP
reaction in the presence of 6 primers, then the ampliﬁed products
were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The detection rates and the
sensitivity for SARS-CoV in the LAMP assay are similar to those of
conventional PCR-based methods. Pyrc et al. [22] successfully applied
LAMP to the detection of HCoV-NL63 which was conducted by
agarose gel electrophoresis with favorable sensitivity and speciﬁcity
in cell cultures and clinical specimens. Notably, the detection limit
was found to be 1 copy of RNA template per reaction.
Ampliﬁcation can be detected as the precipitation of magnesium
pyrophosphate or ﬂuorescence dye. This enables the methods to be
carried out in real time by monitoring the turbidity of the pyrophosphate or ﬂuorescence, which has effectively overcome the
limitations of the endpoint detection [23]. A useful RT-LAMP assay
for the diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance of human MERSCoV was developed in this way by Shirato et al. [24], which is
capable of detecting as few as 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA, and is
highly speciﬁc, with no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses. Thai et al. [25] developed a one-step single-tube accelerated
real-time quantitative RT-LAMP assay monitored by real-time
measurement of turbidity in a photometer for the early and rapid
diagnosis of SARS-CoV. In clinical samples, the assay was found to
be 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR with a
detection limit of 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU).
3.2. Sequence-speciﬁc LAMP-based methods
However, if the methods rely on nonspeciﬁc signal transduction
schemes, such as the ﬂuorescence dyes intercalation into any
double-stranded DNA amplicons, or solution turbidity due to the
release of pyrophosphates during polymerization, the possibility of
unexpected signals derived from primer dimer or non-primer reactions cannot be excluded [26]. A sequence-speciﬁc and robust
method for monitoring LAMP and other isothermal ampliﬁcation
reactions that can readily separate true signal from nonspeciﬁc
noise would address this problem. Shirato et al. [27] improved the
RT-LAMP assay by using a quenching probe (QProbe) to monitor
signal, which has the same performance as the standard real-time
RT-PCR assay in the detection of MERS-CoV. Additionally, Huang
et al. [4] established a nucleic acid visualization technique that
combines RT-LAMP and a vertical ﬂow visualization strip (RTLAMP-VF) to detect MERS-CoV. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, two loop
primers (LF and LB) involved in isothermal ampliﬁcation are labeled
with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin, respectively. After
ampliﬁcation, the amplicons labeled with biotin can bind to
colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a
complex which is subsequently captured by an anti-FITC antibody
coated on the text line of the strip (Fig. 1B), thus presenting a
colored line that is visible to the naked eye. In this instance, MERSCoV RNA can be detected with a detection limit of 10 copies/mL.
Scientists from Ellington’s group did plenty of work to both
improve the speciﬁcity of LAMP detection and make readout
3.3. Rolling circle ampliﬁcation-based methods
The rolling circle ampliﬁcation (RCA) has attracted considerable
attention in nucleic acid determination [35,36]. In isothermal
conditions, RCA is capable of a 109-fold signal ampliﬁcation of each
circle within 90 min. An efﬁcient assay for the detection of SARSCoV by RCA was set up in both liquid and solid phases [37], and
presented preliminary results on a small number of clinical respiratory specimens. The main advantage of RCA is that it can be
performed under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and
avoid the generation of false-positive results, which is frequently
encountered in PCR-based assays.
4. Microarray-based methods

simpler and more reliable. They replaced the intercalating dye
typically used for monitoring in real-time ﬂuorescence with a
toehold-mediated strand exchange reaction termed one-step
strand displacement (OSD) and applied it for real-time sequencespeciﬁc veriﬁcation of LAMP amplicons [28e30]. The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 PFU (5e50 PFU/mL) of MERS-CoV in
infected cell culture supernatants within 30e50 min and did not
cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens [31]. Other
strand exchange signal transductions were developed to make
LAMP reaction user-friendly. As shown in Fig. 2, by combining
LAMP with a thermostable invertase, Du et al. can directly transduce MERS coronavirus templates into glucose signals, which can
be easily read by a commercial glucometer, with a sensitivity as low
as 20e100 copies/mL, equating to atto-molar (or low zepto-mole)
[32]. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was also used as
the signal as its analyte was already sensitively detected by commercial pregnancy test kits. The hCG was site-speciﬁcally conjugated to a DNA oligonucleotide, thereby allowing signal
transduction via strand exchange into both capture (signal-off) and
release (signal-on) of hCG in the LAMP based virus assay [33]. The
incorporation of an engineered hCG reporter protein led to LAMPto-hCG signal transduction on low-cost, commercially available
pregnancy test strips. This assay reliably detected as few as 20
copies of virus templates in both human serum and saliva.
Meanwhile, LAMP shows optimal performance at around 65  C,
which always limits its applications. Cai et al. [34] developed a
version of LAMP that used phosphorothioated primers (PS-LAMP)
to enable more efﬁcient hairpin formation and extension at the
termini of growing concatamers, which therefore worked at much
lower temperatures. The sensitivity and selectivity for amplicon
detection with PS-LAMP at 40  C were comparable with a regular
LAMP reaction at 65  C.

The microarray is a detection method with rapid and high
throughput. For this method, the coronavirus RNA will ﬁrst produce
cDNA labeled with speciﬁc probes through reverse transcription.
Then these labeled cDNAs will be loaded into each well and hybridize with solid-phase oligonucleotides ﬁxed on the microarray,
followed by a series of washing steps to remove free DNAs. Finally,
the coronavirus RNA can be detected by the detection of speciﬁc
probes. Due to its superiority, the microarray assay has been widely
used in the detection of coronavirus [38].
Shi et al. [39] designed a 60mer oligonucleotide microarray according to the sequence of TOR2 and successfully applied it to the
detection of SARS coronavirus in clinical samples. However,
considering the rapid mutation of SARS-CoV, Guo et al. [40]
developed a microarray to detect 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations among the spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV
with 100% accuracy in sample detection. Since coronavirus may
lead to a sudden outbreak, it is of great signiﬁcance that diagnostic
assays are able to detect a wide range of coronaviruses and are be
deployable at or near the point of care (POC). Therefore, Luna et al.
[41] designed a nonﬂuorescent low-cost, low-density oligonucleotide array for detecting the whole coronavirus genus with a
sensitivity equal to that of individual real-time RT-PCR, and Hardick
et al. [42] evaluated a novel, portable, and near-POC diagnostic
platform based on the microarray chip, the Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP), which has a good performance in identifying virus and
acceptable detection limit.
5. Newly developed methods
The RNA-targeting CRISPR associated enzyme Cas13 has
recently been adapted for rapid and portable sensing of nucleic
acids [43,44]. Zhang’s group demonstrated that Cas13 can be programmed to target and destroy the genomes of diverse mammalian
single stranded RNA viruses (Fig. 3) [45]. They developed a platform
termed SHERLOCK (speciﬁc high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter
unlocking) that combined isothermal preampliﬁcation with Cas13
to detect single molecules of RNA or DNA [46]. It can detect Dengue
or Zika virus single-stranded RNA as well as mutations in patient
liquid biopsy samples. Their lately protocol for COVID-19 entitled
“A protocol for detection of COVID-19 using CRISPR diagnostics” has
been reported on website (https://broad.io/sherlockprotocol),
which may provide some reference points for researchers interested in further advancing this diagnostics system, highlighting its
potential as a multiplexable, portable, rapid, and quantitative
detection platform of nucleic acids.
6. Summary and prospect
Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly relies on the
detection of the coronavirus RNA. It is of great importance to select

equipment and educated analysts, which is only possibly accomplished by a well-established laboratory. LAMP is an ultrasensitive
nucleic acid ampliﬁcation method that can often detect small
numbers of DNA or RNA templates within roughly an hour, but the
requirement for high temperatures still limits its applicability. As
for the microarray, the high cost inevitably limits its further
application in the detection of coronaviruses. Therefore, it is still
necessary to develop more effective and practical methods to
overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods in the future.
To date, considerable efforts have been made to improve the
detection of coronavirus and a variety of improved or new approaches have been developed. In practical applications, several
methods are usually combined to avoid the drawbacks of using
single method as much as possible. In short, with the rapid
development of new technologies and methods, we believe that
there will be more excellent and efﬁcient detection methods
developed in the future, which would provide scientists/clinicians
with more choices. At the same time, only by balancing the advantages and disadvantages of various detection assays according
to speciﬁc purposes can we obtain the most economical and
optimal option.

Abstract
Background and purpose: Irregularities of angiogenesis may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes
complications. Pramlintide is an amylin analogue administered for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The present investigation aimed at surveying the effect of pramlintide on angiogenesis-related markers in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
Experimental approach: The proliferation of cells was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The effect of pramlintide on migration was estimated by
Transwell® assay. in vitro evaluation of angiogenesis was performed by tube formation assay. The secretion
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to the supernatant of HUVECs was measured by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Findings / Results: Pramlintide exhibited no inhibitory effect on HUVECs proliferation. It significantly
increased cell migration at the concentration of 1 µg/mL. Pramlintide (1 µg/mL) also enhanced average tubules
length, size, and the mean number of junctions. However, there was not any significant change in VEGF release
from HUVECs.
Conclusion and implications: Findings of this research revealed the effect of pramlintide on angiogenesisrelated markers via enhancing migration and tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting a worthwhile proposition for
further clinical researches on improving vascular complications and healing of diabetic wounds.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes mellitus is a complicated endocrine
disorder and the fourth leading cause of death
in the world. This common health problem
affects about 422 million persons (8.5% of the
adult population) worldwide and its prevalence
is estimated to increase to 642 million in the
next 25 years (1,2). Vascular complications of
diabetes are important reasons for mortality and
morbidity in diabetic patients (3). Endothelial
dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis are
considered as the main pathological features of
diabetic vascular problems (4). Angiogenesis
refers to the development of new blood vessels

from preexisting vessels (5). This process
occurs during some normal and pathological
conditions through a series of organized stages.
During angiogenesis, various regulating factors
are involved in the stimulation of endothelial
cells, degradation of the capillary basement
membrane, capillary sprouting, migration, tube
formation, and finally in maturation and
stabilization of the new vessel (6). Diabetes is
associated with abnormal angiogenesis in a
tissue-specific manner.

Main

Enhanced angiogenesis is a main
pathological
characteristic
in
diabetic
retinopathy
and
reduced
angiogenesis
contributes to the impaired wound healing,
peripheral artery diseases, and various ischemic
conditions (7).
Pramlintide
is
an
injectable
antihyperglycemic drug, approved for the
treatment of types 1 and 2 diabetic patients who
take insulin and do not reach the desired
glucose levels (8). It regulates blood glucose
levels through slowing gastric emptying,
stimulating satiety and decreasing secretion of
glucagon. Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of
human amylin and functions as an amylin
agonist (9). Amylin or islet amyloid
polypeptide (IAPP), is a peptide hormone that
acts as a part of the endocrine system of the
pancreas in controlling postprandial blood
glucose along with insulin (10).
Amylin indeed belongs to the calcitonin
gene peptide superfamily, whose members are
calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP), adrenomedullin, and amylin with
some similar biological effects due to the
similarity in their structures and receptors (11).
There are pieces of evidence that most members
of this superfamily have important effects on
angiogenesis. Adrenomedullin functions as an
angiogenic growth factor and inhibits apoptosis
in endothelial cells (12). Calcitonin promotes
several stages of angiogenesis via a direct effect
on endothelial cells and CGRP also stimulates
angiogenesis and facilitates wound healing
(13,14).
Regarding the role of calcitonin superfamily
peptides on angiogenesis and cross-reactivity
between their receptors, the aim of this study
was to evaluate the effect of pramlintide as an
amylin analog on angiogenesis in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Iran). Transwell inserts were obtained from
SPL Life Sciences Co., Ltd. (Gyeonggi-do,
Korea). Geltrex was purchased from GibcoBRL, Life Technologies Inc. (California,
USA). Calcein acetoxymethyl dye was
prepared from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.
(Santa Cruz, Canada). Recombinant human
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit for its evaluation were purchased
from PeproTech, Inc. (New Jersey, USA).

Cell culture
HUVECs (Pasteur Institute, Tehran,
I.R. Iran) were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100
U/mL penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator. All experiments
were performed in 2 to 4 passages.
MTT assay
The viability of HUVECs was assessed
using the MTT method (15). Briefly, the cells
were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in the 96-well
plates. After 24 h plating, HUVECs were
treated with pramlintide at 1, 2, 5, 10, and
20 µg/mL and then incubated for an additional
24 h. After that, MTT reagent (10 μL) was
added and cultivated for 4 h at 37 °C. The
formazan crystals resulting from MTT reaction
with living cells were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide and absorbance was measured using
a microplate reader/spectrophotometer (BioTek, PowerWave XS, USA) at 570 nm. The
cells without any exposure to pramlintide were
considered as control. The viability of treated
HUVECs was evaluated by comparison of the
absorbance of each sample with control. All
experiments were done in triplicate.
Cell migration assay
Cell migration was evaluated using
Transwell® inserts with 8 μm pore sizes. In
brief, HUVECs were treated with vehicle or
pramlintide (1 and 10 µg/mL) or with VEGF
(10 ng/mL, as the standard control) for 24 h and
then added to the upper chamber (3 × 104
cells/well). The desired chemo-attractant
(growth medium supplemented with 20% FBS)
was placed into the lower chamber. After 4 h
incubation, the media and non-migrated cells

the supernatants was calculated using a
standard curve and expressed in pg/mL (18).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). For statistical
analysis, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc test was
done using SPSS software version 18.0. The
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Capillary tube formation assay
For evaluation of the effect of pramlintide on
tube formation, the GeltrexTM reduced growth
factor basement membrane matrix was used.
Briefly, the ice-cold 24-well plates were coated
with GeltrexTM (10 ng/mL) and incubated at 37
°C for 30 min. HUVECs were plated (1.2 ×
105/well) in the absence or presence of the
pramlintide (1 and 10 µg/mL) or VEGF
(2 ng/mL) on the polymerized GeltrexTM
surface layer in DMEM. After 24 h incubation
at 37 °C / 5% CO2, the cells were washed with
Hanks balanced salt solution and stained with
calcein acetoxymethyl dye. Photographs of
each well were taken with a Nikon Coolpix
camera attached to an inverted fluorescent
microscope. The average tubules length, size
and the mean number of junctions were
measured in 5 high power fields of each well
using AngioQuant software (MATLAB, Inc.
Tampere, Finland) (17).

RESULTS
Effect of pramlintide on HUVECs viability
The viability of HUVECs was assessed by
the MTT method after 24 h exposure to
pramlintide. Treatment with pramlintide at the
concentration range of 1-20 µg/mL caused no
inhibitory effect on HUVECs proliferation
(Fig. 1). Since there were no significant
differences between various concentrations,
pramlintide was used at the concentrations of
1 and 10 µg/mL in further studies.
Effect of pramlintide on HUVECs migration
The effect of pramlintide on the migration of
endothelial cells was evaluated by Transwell®
assay. As shown in Fig. 2, administration of
pramlintide at 1 µg/mL significantly increased
cell migration compared to the control after
24 h incubation (P < 0.05). However, this result
was significantly less than the VEGF effect
(P < 0.05).

VEGF secretion assay
VEGF concentration was measured in
supernatants of treated HUVECs by an ELISA
kit according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. The amount of VEGF released in

ng/mL) and pramlintide (1 µg/mL) after 24 h
treatment in HUVECs (Figs. 4A-C). The
highest average tubules length, size, and the
mean number of junctions were observed in
VEGF-treated cells compared to the control
cells (P < 0.001). Pramlintide at 1 µg/mL also
caused a significant enhancement in average

Effect of pramlintide on tube formation of
HUVECs
Tube formation assay on GeltrexTM
basement membrane matrix was used for in
vitro evaluation of angiogenesis. Figure 3A
represents the tubular structures in normal
untreated HUVECs. Treatments with VEGF
(Fig. 3B) and pramlintide at 1 µg/mL (Fig. 3C)
promoted capillary tube formation compared to
tubules length, andsize and the mean number
of junctions in comparison with normal
untreated HUVECs (P < 0.001). Treatment
with 10 µg/mL failed to increase the
average tubules length size and number of
junctions compared with 1 µg/mL of
pramlintide (P > 0.05).

Effect of pramlintide on VEGF secretion
The effect of pramlintide on VEGF secretion
in the cell culture supernatants was tested using
an ELISA kit. No significant changes were
observed after the administration of pramlintide
in VEGF release into the supernatants of
HUVECs (Fig. 5).

The effects of CGRP on migration and tube
formation have been equal or more potent than
that of the VEGF effect (14).
In the present study, pramlintide (1-20
µg/mL) had no significant effect on HUVECs
proliferation though no inhibitory effect on cell
viability was observed. Our results also
revealed that pramlintide 1 µg/mL but not 10
µg/mL promoted migration and capillary tube
formation. In a recent investigation, pramlintide
promoted neurogenesis and prevented the
mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis with an
optimal effect at 250-300 nM (about 1-1.2
µg/mL) (22). Low concentration of a human
amylin fragment (3 μM) has also been
associated with stimulating VEGF secretion
from endothelial cells and preserving the
survival of neuron-like cells however it has
shown toxic effects on cell proliferation at its
high concentration (20 µM) (23). Moreover,
amylin has been related to vascular damages
dependent on its aggregated form. It seems that
the diverse effects of amylin may be mediated
by various amylin receptors.
Our results showed the activity of
pramlintide on increasing HUVECs migration
at 1 µg/mL which was significantly less than
VEGF effect (P < 0.05). While CGRP (1 nM)
as a member of amylin superfamily has shown
a similar effect to that of VEGF (20 ng/mL) on
HUVECs migration in the study of Tuo et al.
(14).
In this study, no significant change was
found in VEGF secretion after exposure of
HUVECs
to
pramlintide. Since the
upregulation of VEGF expression and also its
release have been reported by other members of
amylin superfamily, evaluation of VEGF
mRNA expression using reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), along
with peptide measurements by more accurate
methods such as western blotting is
recommended.
Regarding
our
results,
significant
differences were observed between two
concentrations of pramlintide on average
tubules length and size and the number of
junctions and it could be proposed that
pramlintide may have a concentration-

DISCUSSION
Pramlintide is a new glucose-lowering agent
which has been effective in reducing
glycosylated hemoglobin and improving
glycemic control in diabetic patients in
combination therapy with mealtime insulin.
Unlike amylin which has an extreme toxic
amyloidogenicity effect and is unsuitable for
clinical use, pramlintide is a non-aggregating
peptide that prevents amyloid formation (19).
Angiogenesis shows a critical role in the
pathogenesis of some major complications of
diabetes.
In this study, pramlintide, as an amylin
analogue, promoted angiogenesis markers by
increasing migration and tube formation in
HUVECs, however, no significant changes
were observed in the VEGF releaseed into the
supernatants of HUVECs.
Amylin belongs to a superfamily of closely
related genes with similar biological activity
profile and cross-reactivity between receptors,
which are distributed in many tissues, such as
brain,
gastrointestinal,
cardiovascular,
endothelial, and smooth muscle tissues (20).
The main receptors for these structurally related
peptides include calcitonin receptor, calcitonin
receptor-like receptor (CRLR), and receptoractivity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) that are
co-expressed in different proportions in various
tissues. It is proven that some of these receptors
such as RAMPs have a critical role in
angiogenesis during wound healing (21).
However, the role of amylin in angiogenesis is
not fully understood, unlike other members. It
is well known that adrenomedullin is a
modulator of growth and movement, protector
from apoptosis, and a potent angiogenic growth
factor in endothelial cells via stimulation of Akt
and mitogen-activated protein kinase and
upregulation of VEGF expression through
CRLR/RAMP2-CRLR/RAMP3 receptors (12).
Calcitonin promotes proliferation, migration,
invasion, and tube formation in endothelial
cells in a concentration-dependent manner and
similarly to VEGF (13). CGRP also increases
VEGF expression and stimulates proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial
cells through activation of adenosine
monophosphate-activated
protein
kinase

Effect of pramlintide on angiogenesis

dependent effect on angiogenesis with
proangiogenic effects at lower concentrations.
Some possible mechanisms for enhancing
angiogenesis by pramlintide may be considered
based on its potential pharmacological
activities and the cellular signaling pathways of
pramlintide and amylin. Wu et al. have shown
the effect of pramlintide in reducing the
expression of some matrix metalloproteinases
including MMP3, MMP9, and MMP13
enzymes, and improving neuronal cell survival
(22). Specific MMPs such as MMP-2 are
involved in enhancing angiogenesis by degrading
the capillary basement membrane (24).
Finally, it could be assumed that probable
antioxidant effect of pramlintide may be an
indirect mechanism for its possible proangiogenic effect. Pramlintide has reduced
oxidized
low-density
lipoprotein
and
nitrotyrosine and prevented from the reduction
in the total radical-trapping antioxidant
parameter in plasma samples of diabetic
patients (25). Pramlintide has shown a helpful
effect on antioxidant enzymes such as
superoxide
dismutase
and
glutathione
peroxidase and on the stress marker heme
oxygenase-1. It also resulted in a significant
decrease in the production of reactive oxygen
species and lipid peroxidation in a neuronal
model of oxidative stress in vitro (26).
Although enhancement of angiogenesis may
be helpful in improving of such diabetes
complications such as wound healing and
ischemic conditions but may aggregate other
problems like diabetic retinopathy. Concerning
the tissue-specific manner of angiogenesis in
diabetes, more investigations should be
performed to elucidate the effect of pramlintide
on angiogenesis in different tissues.

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a kind of viral pneumonia which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been marked as
the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population after the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the
general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss current knowledge of molecular immune pathogenesis,
diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 on the base of the present understanding of SARS-CoV and MERSCoV infections, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for
combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia, which was named as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO on the February
11, 2020, has rapidly increased in epidemic scale [1]. On the same
day, the international virus classiﬁcation commission announced
that the novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is not the ﬁrst
severe respiratory disease outbreak caused by the coronavirus. Just
in the past two decades, coronaviruses have caused three epidemic
diseases, namely, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2]. At present, the cases of COVID-19 have been found in many countries
around the world [3]. According to the latest data, up to the March
1, 2020, the number of conﬁrmed cases in China reached 79,968, of
which 2,873 were dead, and 41,681 were cured. In addition to
China, the number of conﬁrmed cases in other countries also
reached 7,041, of which 105 were dead, and 459 were cured. On the
31st of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)

Main

announced that COVID-19 was listed as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), meaning that it may pose
risks to multiple countries and requires a coordinated international
response. The review tries to explain the molecular immune
pathogenesis and diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide a reference
for the prevention and drug development of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
based on the recent research progress of SARS-CoV-2 and the
knowledge from researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
2. Virology of SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive sense
single-stranded RNA genome (26e32 kb) [4]. Four coronavirus
genera (a, b, g, d) have been identiﬁed so far, with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) detected in the a coronavirus (HCoV-229E and
NL63) and b coronavirus (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1) genera [5]. In late December 2019, patients presenting with cough, fever, and dyspnea with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) due to an unidentiﬁed microbial infection were
reported in Wuhan, China. Virus genome sequencing of ﬁve patients with pneumonia hospitalized from December 18 to
December 29, 2019, revealed the presence of a previously unknown
b-CoV strain in all of them [6]. This isolated novel b-CoV shows 88%
identity to the sequence of two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and about 50% identity to the sequence of MERS-

CoV [6]. The novel b-CoV was then named “SARS-CoV-2” by the
International Virus Classiﬁcation Commission. The phylogenetic
tree of SARS-like coronaviruses complete genome sequences is

clearly depicted in Fig. 1A.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of typical CoVs and
contains at least ten open reading frames (ORFs). The ﬁrst ORFs

(A) This phylogeny shows evolution of SARS-like b-coronaviruses including samples from human (n ¼ 20), bat (n ¼ 22), civet (n ¼ 3) and pangolin (n ¼ 6). The phylogenetic tree of
complete genome sequences of coronaviruses was obtained and analyzed with Nextstrain (https://github.com/blab/sars-like-cov). (B) Coronaviruses form enveloped and spherical
particles of 100e160 nm in diameter. They contain a positivesense single stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of 26e32 kb in size. In SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the 50 terminal two-thirds of the genome ORF1a/b encodes polyproteins, which form the viral replicase transcriptase complex. The other ORFs on the one-third of the genome encode four
main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as several accessory proteins.

(ORF1a/b), about two-thirds of viral RNA, are translated into two
large polyproteins. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, two polyproteins,
pp1a and pp1ab, are processed into 16 non-structural proteins
(nsp1-nsp16), which form the viral replicase transcriptase complex
[7]. Those nsps rearrange membranes originating from the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (RER) into double-membrane vesicles
where viral replication and transcription occur [8,9]. The other
ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 on the one-third of the genome encode four
main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N)
and membrane (M) proteins, as well as several accessory proteins
with unknown functions which do not participate in viral replication (Fig. 1B).
Several groups of scientists in China have all discovered that
SARS-CoV-2, just like SARS-CoV, requires the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] as a receptor to enter cells [10].
The binding of the virus with host cell receptors is a signiﬁcant
determinant for the pathogenesis of infection. SARS-CoV most
likely originated in bats [11]and adapted to non-bat ACE2 variants
as it crossed species to infect humans [12]. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP4, also known as CD26) was identiﬁed as a functional receptor
for MERS-CoV, because the receptor-binding S1 domain of the
MERS-CoV spike protein was copuriﬁed with DPP4 speciﬁcally from
lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells [13]. MERS-CoV can bind DPP4
from multiple species, which promotes the transmission to humans
and other species, and infection of cells from a large number of
species [14]. A better understanding of the relative effects of receptor binding and protease action will help predict whether speciﬁc zoonotic coronaviruses infect humans and the possibility of
adaptation.

vesicles containing the virus particles then fuse with the plasma
membrane to release the virus [2].
3.2. Antigen presentation in coronavirus infection
While the virus enters the cells, its antigen will be presented to
the antigen presentation cells(APC), which is a central part of the
body’s anti-viral immunity. Antigenic peptides are presented by
major histocompatibility complex (MHC; or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans) and then recognized by virus-speciﬁc
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Hence, the understanding of antigen presentation of SARS-CoV-2 will help our comprehension of
COVID-19 pathogenesis. Unfortunately, there is still lack of any
report about it, and we can only get some information from previous researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The antigen presentation of SARS-CoV mainly depends on MHC I molecules [24],
but MHC II also contributes to its presentation. Previous research
shows numerous HLA polymorphisms correlate to the susceptibility of SARS-CoV, such as HLA-B*4601, HLA-B*0703, HLA-DR
B1*1202 [25] and HLA-Cw*0801 [26], whereas the HLA-DR0301,
HLA-Cw1502 and HLA-A*0201 alleles are related to the protection from SARS infection [27]. In MERS-CoV infection, MHC II
molecules, such as HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:0, are
associated with the susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection [28]. Besides, gene polymorphisms of MBL (mannose-binding lectin)
associated with antigen presentation are related to the risk of SARSCoV infection [29]. These researches will provide valuable clues for
the prevention, treatment, and mechanism of COVID-19.
3.3. Humoral and cellular immunity

3. Pathogenesis of COVID-19
Patients with COVID-19 show clinical manifestations including
fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or
decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia [15], which are similar to the symptoms of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infections [16]. Hence, although the pathogenesis of
COVID-19 is poorly understood, the similar mechanisms of SARSCoV and MERS-CoV still can give us a lot of information on the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to facilitate our recognition
of COVID-19.
3.1. Coronavirus entry and replication
Coronavirus S protein has been reported as a signiﬁcant determinant of virus entry into host cells [2]. The envelope spike
glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor, ACE2 for SARS-CoV [10]
and SARS-CoV-2 [17], CD209L(a C-type lectin, also called L-SIGN)
for SARS-CoV [18], DPP4 for MERS-CoV [13]. The entry of SARS-CoV
into cells was initially identiﬁed to be accomplished by direct
membrane fusion between the virus and plasma membrane [19].
Belouzard et al. [20] found that a critical proteolytic cleavage event
occurred at SARS-CoV S protein at position (S20 ) mediated the
membrane fusion and viral infectivity. MERS-CoV also has evolved
an abnormal two-step furin activation for membrane fusion [21].
Besides membrane fusion, the clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis mediated SARS-CoV entry too [22,23]. After the
virus enters the cells, the viral RNA genome is released into the
cytoplasm and is translated into two polyproteins and structural
proteins, after which the viral genome begins to replicate [5]. The
newly formed envelope glycoproteins are inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi, and the nucleocapsid
is formed by the combination of genomic RNA and nucleocapsid
protein. Then, viral particles germinate into the endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). At last, the

Antigen presentation subsequently stimulates the body’s humoral and cellular immunity, which are mediated by virus-speciﬁc
B and T cells. Similar to common acute viral infections, the antibody
proﬁle against SARS-CoV virus has a typical pattern of IgM and IgG
production. The SARS-speciﬁc IgM antibodies disappear at the end
of week 12, while the IgG antibody can last for a long time, which
indicates IgG antibody may mainly play a protective role [30], and
the SARS-speciﬁc IgG antibodies primarily are S-speciﬁc and Nspeciﬁc antibodies [2]. Comparing to humoral responses, there are
more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus. The latest
report shows the number of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients signiﬁcantly is reduced,
whereas its status is excessive activation, as evidenced by high
proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 3.47%) and CD38 (CD8 39.4%) doublepositive fractions [31]. Similarly, the acute phase response in patients with SARS-CoV is associated with severe decrease of CD4þ T
and CD8þ T cells. Even if there is no antigen, CD4þ and CD8þ
memory T cells can persist for four years in a part of SARS-CoV
recovered individuals and can perform T cell proliferation, DTH
response and production of IFN-g [32]. Six years after SARS-CoV
infection, speciﬁc T-cell memory responses to the SARS-CoV S
peptide library could still be identiﬁed in 14 of 23 recovered SARS
patients [33]. The speciﬁc CD8þ T cells also show a similar effect on
MERS-CoV clearance in mice [34]. These ﬁndings may provide
valuable information for the rational design of vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2.
3.4. Cytokine storm in COVID-19
The report in Lancet shows ARDS is the main death cause of
COVID-19. Of the 41 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients admitted in the
early stages of the outbreak, six died from ARDS [15]. ARDS is the
common immunopathological event for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV infections [31]. One of the main mechanisms for

X. Li et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 10 (2020) 102e108

ARDS is the cytokine storm, the deadly uncontrolled systemic inﬂammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18,
IL-33, TNF-a, TGFb, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5,
CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) by immune effector cells in SARS-CoV
infection [15,35e37]. Similar to those with SARS-CoV, individuals
with severe MERS-CoV infection show elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-a,
and CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL-10 in serum compared to those with the
mild-moderate disease [38]. The cytokine storm will trigger a violent attack by the immune system to the body, cause ARDS and
multiple organ failure, and ﬁnally lead to death in severe cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, just like what occurs in SARS-CoV and MERSCoV infection [31].
3.5. Coronavirus immune evasion
To better survive in host cells, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use
multiple strategies to avoid immune responses. The evolutionarily
conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) can be recognized by pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs). However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can induce
the production of double-membrane vesicles that lack PRRs and
then replicate in these vesicles, thereby avoiding the host detection
of their dsRNA [39]. IFN-I(IFN-a and IFN-b) has a protective effect
on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, but the IFN-I pathway is
inhibited in infected mice [40,41]. Accessory protein 4a of MERSCoV may block the induction of IFN at the level of MDA5 activation through direct interaction with double-stranded RNA [42].
Besides, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and membrane proteins of MERSCoV inhibit nuclear transport of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and
activation of IFN b promoter [43]. The antigen presentation can also
be affected by the coronavirus. For example, gene expression
related to antigen presentation is down-regulated after MERS-CoV
infection [44]. Therefore, destroying the immune evasion of SARSCoV-2 is imperative in its treatment and speciﬁc drug development.
4. Diagnosis of COVID-19
Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is mainly based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and some auxiliary examinations, such as nucleic acid detection, CT scan, immune
identiﬁcation technology (Point-of-care Testing (POCT) of IgM/IgG,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and blood culture.
However, the clinical symptoms and signs of patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 are highly atypical, including respiratory symptoms,
cough, fever, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia. Therefore, auxiliary
examinations are necessary for the diagnosis of COVID-19, just as
the epidemiological history.
4.1. Nucleic acid detection technology
The two commonly used nucleic acid detection technologies for
SARS-CoV-2 are real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing. The authoritative
identiﬁcation method for SARS-CoV-2 is virus blood culture and
high-throughput sequencing of the whole genome [1]. However,
the application of high-throughput sequencing technology in
clinical diagnosis is limited because of its equipment dependency
and high cost. So RT-qPCR is the most common, effective and
straightforward method for detecting pathogenic viruses in respiratory secretions and blood [45].
After the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, many companies
soon launched RT-qPCR test kits for clinical diagnosis. The Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) recommends the use of speciﬁc primers and probes in the ORF1ab and N

105

gene regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR. The patient is
deﬁned as having a laboratory-conﬁrmed infection when both
targets
are
positive
(http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/
t20200121_211337.html). Chu et al. [46] described two 1-step RTqPCR assays (TaqMan-based ﬂuorescence signal) to detect two
different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome separately. The
negative control samples were all conﬁrmed as negative ones,
while samples from two SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were
conﬁrmed as positive ones in respiratory specimens by this
method. Another study showed that the positive rate of SARS-CoV2 was 91.7% (11/12) in the patients’ self-collected saliva by using RTqPCR (non-probes SYBR based ﬂuorescence signal), which suggests
that saliva is a promising non-invasive specimen for the diagnosis,
monitoring, and infection control of patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection [47]. RT-qPCR detection also showed high sensitivity
and speciﬁcity for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [48]. However, ﬁve patients with negative results of RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2
may present with positive chest CT ﬁndings, and repeated swab
tests (RT-qPCR) eventually conﬁrmed that all patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2 [49]. The detection of SARS-CoV using RT-qPCR
can only achieve a sensitivity of 50%e79%, depending on the protocol used the sample type and number of clinical specimens
collected [50]. Thus, it is essential to improve the detection rate of
RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, RT-qPCR has some
other shortcomings, including certain biological safety hazards
brought by the retention and operation of patient samples,
cumbersome nucleic acid detection operations, and long waiting
time for results.
4.2. CT scans and other diagnostic methods
For the diagnosis of COVID-19, although RT-qPCR is speciﬁc, its
false-negative rate cannot be ignored because of the severe consequences of missed diagnosis. So many clinicians proposed CT
scans should be one necessary auxiliary diagnostic method because
it is more sensitive. For individuals with a high clinical suspicion of
SARS-CoV-2 infection with negative RT-qPCR screening, a combination of repeated RT-qPCR tests and chest CT scan may be helpful.
Especially the high-resolution CT (HRCT) for the chest is essential
for early diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity of patients
with SARS-CoV-2 [51]. Several studies have analyzed chest CT images of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [52,53]. The typical CT
images show bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and
consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded
morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Lung involvement
with a peripheral predominance was also seen in patients with
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, and the chest CT showed that
disease progressed with ground-glass opacities and consolidation,
which is similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection [54,55]. According
to those ﬁndings, CT scans have a great clinical diagnostic value for
COVID-19, especially in the high prevalence area of SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, CT scans also have some shortcomings, such
as indistinguishability from other viral pneumonia and the hysteresis of abnormal CT imaging.
Given the shortcomings of the currently used nucleic acid
detection and CT scans for the diagnosis of COVID-19, clinical laboratories should apply some immunological detection kits that
target viral antigens or antibodies as soon as possible. Currently,
POCT of IgM/IgG and ELISA kits for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed and pre-tested by some companies and have shown higher
detection rates than nucleic acid detection, but there is still no
product or published article. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV N-based
IgG ELISA (94.7%) is signiﬁcantly higher than that of SARS-CoV Sbased IgG ELISA (58.9%) [48], but the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/
IgM remains to be studied. Hence, developing other sensitive and

106

X. Li et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 10 (2020) 102e108

speciﬁc auxiliary methods is necessary and urgent for the diagnosis
of COVID-19.
5. Current treatment strategies for COVID-19
Just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2,56], there is currently no
clinically proven speciﬁc antiviral agent available for SARS-CoV-2
infection. The supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy,
conservation ﬂuid management, and the use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics to cover secondary bacterial infection, remains to be
the most important management strategy [15]. According to the
research on molecular mechanisms of coronavirus infection [57]
and the genomic organization of SARS-CoV-2 [6], there are several
potential therapeutic targets to repurpose the existing antiviral
agents or develop effective interventions against this novel
coronavirus.
5.1. Virally targeted inhibitors
Remdesivir, an adenosine analogue that can target the RNAdependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis, has
been a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses
(including SARS/MERS-CoV) infections in cultured cells [58], mice
[59] and nonhuman primate models [60,61]. The Washington
Department of Health administrated remdesivir intravenously ﬁrst
and found that remdesivir might have potential protection from
SARS-CoV-2 infection [62]. Then remdesivir and chloroquine have
been demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 effectively in vitro [63].
Hence, other nucleoside analogues, such as favipiravir, ribavirin and
galidesivir [56,64], may be potentially clinically applicable against
SARS-CoV-2. Chymotrypsin-like (3C-like protease, 3CLpro) and
papain-like protease (PLP) are non-structural proteins, which have
an essential function for coronaviral replication and can inhibit the
host innate immune responses [65]. So 3CLpro inhibitors, such as
cinanserin [66] and ﬂavonoids [67], and PLP inhibitors, such as
diarylheptanoids [68], are other attractive choices to ﬁght against
SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell as a
functional receptor of coronaviruses. So blocking the binding of S
protein with ACE2 is also a meaningful strategy against SARS-CoV-2
infection [10].

SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, there may be many promising targets for SARS-CoV-2,
but more laboratory and clinical evidence still should be explored.
The WHO is working with Chinese scientists to launch more than
80 clinical trials on potential treatments for SARS-CoV-2. Traditional Chinese medicine seems to have some effects in the supportive treatments. Some new pharmaceutical drugs, including HIV
drugs and stem cells, were testiﬁed in those clinical trials.
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the occurrence and development of SARS-CoV-2
depend on the interaction between the virus and the individual’s
immune system. Viral factors include virus type, mutation, viral
load, viral titer, and viability of the virus in vitro. The individual’s
immune system factors include genetics (such as HLA genes), age,
gender, nutritional status, neuroendocrine-immune regulation, and
physical status. These factors all contribute to whether an individual is infected with the virus, the duration and severity of the
disease, and the reinfection. In the early stages of the epidemic,
accurate diagnosis helps control the spread of the disease. It is
imperative to develop new, safe, accurate, fast and simple new
technologies for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Of course, physicians will
intentionally intervene in the two factors to make them develop
into a direction beneﬁcial to human health, which can help patients
recover as soon as possible. However, it must not be considered that
medical intervention can achieve a 100% curative effect.

5.2. Antibody and plasma therapy
Appendix A. Supplementary data
It has also been reported that there are many convalescent patients donating plasma against SARS-CoV-2, just as SARS-CoV [69]
and MERS-CoV [70] trials. It has preliminary acquired favorable
results in acute, severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, the generation of recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a
fairly straightforward path to neutralize SARS-CoV. CR3022, a SARS
coronavirus-speciﬁc human monoclonal antibody, can bind
potently with the receptor-binding domain(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2
and has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics
of SARS-CoV-2 infections [71]. Other monoclonal antibodies
neutralizing SARS-CoV, such as m396, CR3014, could be an alternative for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [72].
5.3. Vaccines
Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are essential for reducing disease
severity, viral shedding and transmission, thus helping to control
the coronavirus outbreaks. There are several vaccination strategies
against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV tested in animals, including a liveattenuated virus, viral vectors, inactivated virus, subunit vaccines,
recombinant DNA, and proteins vaccines [73]. These studies are in
progress, but it requires months to years to develop the vaccines for
